    <em>Teacher of Computer Science at <strong>Bishop Kelly High School</strong></em>
  </p>
  </<p>I teach a course called Exploring Computer Science which introduces students to HTML & CSS and also Java programming.  I have 15 years of CS industry experience where I worked
  at HP on ColorLaser printers and MFP devices.  I left for family reasons, and then went into teaching.  I've enjoyed teaching and have moved to meld my CS skills with my teaching skills.  I enjoy updating my technology skills, and am currently focused on adding JavaSript and React Native to my skillset</p>
